# Persistent Session and JWT token based User Authentication

```
- Typescript
- JWT token
- Persistence Session Id
- Mongo DB
```
Note:- This repository is only for trying out the things so do not try both JWT token with persistent session together on production.

In memory is also required if we use persistent session(Reddis/Memcached)
